Akhuwat\n              aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between\n              the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and\n              sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only\n              helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined\n              with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of\n              poverty.\n            \"\n            />\n            <Heading as=\"h3\" content=\"Philosophy of Akhuwat\" />\n            <Text\n              content=\"\n              Akhuwat derives its name from ‘mawakhaat’ or brotherhood, the\n              earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the\n              Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to\n              Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit\n              which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the\n              migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood\n              through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood\n              entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the\n              society.\"\n            />\n            <Heading as=\"h3\" content=\"Our Values\" />\n            <Text\n              content=\"\n              Interest-free Loans – The loan provided will be interest free\n              since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot\n              be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\n              Use of Religious Places – Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of\n              social and economic development through making Mosques, churches\n              and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic\n              history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of\n              Prophet Muhammad PBUH, mosques were used for worship, training and\n              providing services. With this, comes the Transparency, Good\n              Governance, participation and accountability.

Akhuwat\n              aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between\n              the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and\n              sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only\n              helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined\n              with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of\n              poverty.\n            \"\n            />\n            <Heading as=\"h3\" content=\"Philosophy of Akhuwat\" />\n            <Text\n              content=\"\n              Akhuwat derives its name from ‘mawakhaat’ or brotherhood, the\n              earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the\n              Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to\n              Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit\n              which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the\n              migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood\n              through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood\n              entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the\n              society.\"\n            />\n            <Heading as=\"h3\" content=\"Our Values\" />\n            <Text\n              content=\"\n              Interest-free Loans – The loan provided will be interest free\n              since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot\n              be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\n              Use of Religious Places – Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of\n              social and economic development through making Mosques, churches\n              and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic\n              history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of\n              Prophet Muhammad PBUH, mosques were used for worship, training and\n              providing services.
